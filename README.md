# About Me

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a passionate **Machine Learning and Deep Learning enthusiast** with a strong foundation in AI. I'm continuously exploring innovative applications of AI in real-world problems, with a particular interest in **image processing, classification models**, and **computer vision**.

## Skills

- **Programming Languages:** Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV
- **Machine Learning:** Decision Trees, SVM, K-Nearest Neighbors, and more.
- **Deep Learning:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), RNN, and LSTM.

## Projects

### Malaria Cell Detection using CNN
Developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to detect malaria-infected cells using microscopy images. This model helps automate diagnosis in medical applications.

### Image Classification with EuroSAT dataset
Trained a deep learning model for classifying satellite images from the EuroSAT dataset, focusing on land use and land cover.

### .. etc.
